# Daily Work Schedule

## Description

This project was made in order to help the user plan their work day accordingly. I built this project to learn how to properly use local storage and manipulate it to my advantage along with learning how to use some jQuery. For the user, this project can help keep track on what tasks have to to be preformed and by when they have to be finished.

## Usage

The daily user is displayed the date and is given a 9am-5pm hourly block schedule. In each hour the user can write any task that needs to be accomplished. They will know wheter or not they are on pace because it will show assignments before the current time in grey, the assignment that needs to be accopmlished in red, and any future assignments in green.
